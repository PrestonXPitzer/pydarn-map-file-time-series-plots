# Communication Guidelines

pyDARN is under the Data Analysis Working Group that has set up guidelines on [communication](communication.md) to encourage a positive collaborative environment.
Please follow these guidelines when commenting and reviewing code on GitHub. 

Also please read workflow documentation on issues and [pull requests](PR.md) to communicate effectively for collaborative work.

## Disputes Procedure

If members have a dispute that violates the communication guidelines, and creates a negative environment in the pyDARN community, please follow this procedure to resolve the conflict:
1. Please try resolve the matter between each member offline.
2. If the dispute cannot be resolved, or the environment has become toxic and overwhelming, please contact the [lead developer for pyDARN](https://pydarn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
3. If the dispute cannot be resolved, involves the lead developer, or breaches the [DVWG charter](https://superdarn.github.io/DVWG/docs/charter/) please contact the [chair of ](https://superdarn.github.io/DVWG/about/).

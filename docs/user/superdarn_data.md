# Getting SuperDARN Data 

pyDARN does not provide an interface for downloading data. However, there are other means of getting access to the data. 

The [Data Distribution Working Group (DDWG)](https://github.com/SuperDARN/DDWG) manages the checking and distribution of data. If you have any inquiries, please contact the chair Kevin Krieger at superdarn@usask.ca or submit an [issue on DDWG repo](https://github.com/SuperDARN/DDWG/issues)

## Data Mirrors
To get access to the data, there are two possible data servers: one utilizes *Globus*, and one uses `rsync`, `sftp` and `scp`: 

  - [SuperDARN Canada](https://superdarn.ca/): uses [Globus](https://github.com/SuperDARNCanada/globus) to allow access to the SuperDARN data. 
  - [BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/superdarn/#about): information on data access can be found [here](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/superdarn/#data)
